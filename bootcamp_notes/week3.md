**2. DOM**
___

**1. JSON: ** JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null. It is based upon JavaScript syntax but is distinct from it: some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript. In JSON properties must be strings. To validate JSON code we use a validator.

**Exercise 9**

Create a JSON structure and with a list of “humans” where a human has a name, age, a list of pets (‘cat’, ‘dog’, fish’), if the human has friends or not, and a list of friends.

Notes  
At least 5 humans  
At least 1 human should have friends.

**Clone teacher's repository**  
On ../bootcamp folder, clone https://github.com/glrodasz/frontend-bootcamp.git name_folder, outside the repository.


**2. DOM (Document Object Model): ** The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages. Usually that means JavaScript, but modelling HTML, SVG, or XML documents as objects is not part of the JavaScript language. The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
