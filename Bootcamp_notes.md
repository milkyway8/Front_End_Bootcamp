- **Install Git: ** in order to register the changes made to our files we use Git. Git is a free and open source version control system that provides a Bash emulator use to run command lines. To install Git for Windows go [here](https://git-scm.com/).

- **Configure SSH key: ** to communicate a local to a remote repository we need a SSH key first. A SSH key is compound by a public key and a private key. The first one goes to gitHub, while the second one refers to the machine. These are the steps needed to fully configure a SSH key.
