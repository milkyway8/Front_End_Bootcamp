**a. Install Git:** in order to register the changes made to our files we use Git. Git is a free and open source version control system that provides a Bash emulator use to run command lines. To install Git for Windows go [here](https://git-scm.com/).

___

**b. Configure SSH key:** to communicate a local to a remote repository we need a SSH key first. A SSH key is compound by a public key and a private key. The first one goes to gitHub, while the second one refers to the machine. These are the steps needed to fully configure a SSH key.


- execute the bash command `ssh-keygen`
- create a gitHub account
- execute the bash command `cat ~/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- enter a key label and the public key into your gitHub SSH keys

**c. Install a text editor:** due to the fact that we would need to write code at some point, is useful to employ a text editor instead of an IDE.
